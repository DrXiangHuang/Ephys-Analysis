### TODO
- After exact .tar and make .kkp file, delete the extracted files (except Buddy_06272013_sessInfo.mat)
- Instead of extract to same folder and delete, can we exact to temp folder of system and delete from there?
- Save data to csv in chunk, rather than all at once, saving memory
- Instead of processing all data at once, grab only certain groups/subsections/channels etc.
